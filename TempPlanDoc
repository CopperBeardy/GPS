the plan is to - 

1. get the print and export functionality working on the results page.
2. sort change unit commands out.
3. I want to look at disabling/enabling the results tab depending on whether there is any result to view
4. enabling/disabling the 'Measure distance' button on the front page if there are no start or endpoints.
5. adding remove the capability to the end location list incase someone enters are the wrong result.
6. implementing import for JSON or CSV for start and end location created else were.
7. center the end locaiton list
8. fix the look of the output window so the list is spaced out and not all squashed on the left side
9. Refactor the XAML 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

possible directions ---

A. add map tab which displays the result on a map with customized pins
B. look at creating a mobile applation that incorporates the diatance measure calculator
C. create a web version of the applciation 
D. export the measurement calculator into a nuget package - will require extensive testing, documentation and support

comments:

- many great ideas..
- #6 import from JSON 1.1 ok, dialog design and structure subject to change during the project
- about D:
	- I don't know if readme points to the right references, can you complement your sources?
	- there are some constants that differ on various sites, earth/polar radius?
	- how do we get correct(!) test data? a long straight road!

- Maybe a display field for start location?

14th dec 21:34 - clear out and download a fresh copy of the project and the address worked fine in it, 
there has been something up with my Visual studio for a while I have had problems with other projects, think there 
was a corrupted file or 2 but work well now

Glad that it worked at last. /gemzon

I have tried different variations of lat/lon(*) display, it is difficult to find the `right´ way to do it. They will not align nicely.

1)	Because of proportional font, they will never be aligned. That, of course, is easy to change with a fixed font width.

2)	Then there (always?) will be a different number of decimals.
	Fill with zeros will probably don't look good and in fact kind of misleading; (52.12, -4.12) is not `exactly´ the same as (52.1200, -4.1200).
	(Mathematical it's, needless to say, the same but 54(.0)th latitude is not the same as 54.0000, the latter is a quite precise latitude.)

3)	Let each one use own column. That may look nicer, but only with a fixed font.

(*) Before I saw this project I don't think I would have used 'lon' for longitude. Probably 'long' or maybe 'lng' for code alignment (which I like).
	Now when I have browsed sites I think 'lon' is more common than the other. But I am not still sure this is the way it should be presented.
	This may be a language cultural difference I'm not aware of.
	It's your project, just wanted to share some thoughts.
